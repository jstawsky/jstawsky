Hi, I’m @jstawsky (Joaquin Stawsky)
<br>  I recently recieved a B.S. Magna Cum Laude in Mathematics (Emphasis in Science [Astronomy]) from San Diego State University with a Distinction in Mathematics. In the following public repositories you will find a collection of professional and personal projects, which I contribute to as they come. As a result of NDAs signed and Academic Integrity agreements I am not able to display many of my best works here, but I hope you can find what you are looking for.
</br>
Always open to starting new projects, you can reach me by:
- email: joaquinstawsky@gmail.com
- LinkedIn: [www.linkedin.com/in/joaquin-stawsky](www.linkedin.com/in/joaquin-stawsky)
